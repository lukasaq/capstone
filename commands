Run the following query. Recall that event ID 4769 corresponds to service ticket requests.
event.module:windows_eventlog and event.code:4769
event.module: Filters out events from other data sources such as System Monitor (Sysmon) and Zeek
event.code: Windows event log code that uniquely identifies the type of event


Run the following query to find occurrences of PtH attacks:

event.module:windows_eventlog and event.code:4624 and winlog.event_data.LogonType:9 and winlog.event_data.LogonProcessName:SecLogo


Run the following query to find activity associated with the adversaryâ€™s new session. The new subject ID in this case is the TargetLogonId from the previous log entry. The query is case-sensitive, so ensure that the LogonID is lowercase.

winlog.event_data.SubjectLogonId:0x32e6b93


While delegation is not explicitly denied for the user account, user accounts are permitted to delegate to some degree, so this is not as concerning.
 get-aduser -Identity Bradley.Phillips -Property accountnotdelegated


The user has DC Replicating Domain Changes, as seen from the output of the following command:
Get-ACL "AD:\DC=cda,DC=corp" | Select-Object -Expandproperty access | Where-Object -property ObjectType -eq "1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2"

Now that it is known that the account is over-provisioned, check the Kibana dashboard to see if the attacker utilized the account to conduct a DCSync attack. Run the following query to search for DCSync attacks:
event.code:4662 and message:"1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2"
